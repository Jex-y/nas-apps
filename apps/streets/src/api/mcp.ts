const INSTRUCTIONS = `The connected person's progress towards running every street in London, as CityStrides counts it.

- A street is every named road of one name within one borough. It is made of nodes about 50 m apart, and a node is run
  once a GPS track passes within ${MATCH_RADIUS_METRES} m of it. A street is complete at ${COMPLETION_PERCENT}% of its
  nodes; state is complete, partial or untouched.
- Runs come from Strava, checked every half hour during the day, or from uploaded GPX files. Walks, hikes and bike
  rides count too once switched on. Each new Strava activity sends the person a notification. Connecting Strava needs a
  browser: send the person to the app's Connect page. Everything else can be done here.
- Positions are WGS84 latitude and longitude in degrees, and only Greater London is tracked.
- The street network is imported from OpenStreetMap monthly and is the same for everyone; progress, runs and the
  Strava connection are the connected person's own.`;
