- Amounts are whole pence. Money leaving an account, and anything owed, is negative.
- An account's balance is kept up to date by a bank link, by Hargreaves Lansdown CSV exports (a portfolio, revalued
  daily), or by hand. Only a manual account's balance can be set.
- Every transaction has one or more line items that add up to its amount, and tags live on line items. Splitting a
  transaction replaces all its items; send one item to put it back together or just to tag the whole of it.
- Spending counts line items in cash accounts by calendar month; an item with several tags counts under each.
- Ids are UUIDs; find them with the list tools. A bank can only be linked from the web app, as it needs a login.`;
